## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/html-css-js-projects.git


2. open index.html

 cd html-css-js-projects/projects/04-todo-app

3. Open the project in your browser:

🧠 How It Works

Enter your task in the input field and click Add (or press Enter).

Your task appears below with a circular checkbox and delete button.

All todos are saved automatically in your localStorage.


💾 Local Storage Example

Todos are stored in your browser as JSON data:


[
  {
    "text": "Learn JavaScript",
    "completed": false
  },
  {
    "text": "Build Todo App",
    "completed": true
  }
]
